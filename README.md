# EmoTracker pack for Pokémon Emerald Map Randomizers

Based on the tracker for Pokémon Crystal Key Item Randomizers made by DillonIsMyName and Vicendithas, GitHub repository available [here](https://github.com/vicendithas/pokemon-crystal-randomizer-tracker).
Also uses custom items in the same way as codemann8's ALttPR Full Tracker, GitHub repository available [here](https://github.com/codemann8/alttpr_codetracker_codemann8).

It's an EmoTracker pack with maps for the [Universal Warp Randomizer](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/qel5h4/i_created_a_mod_that_randomizes_the_entire_map_of/) used on Pokémon Emerald, available on PointCrow's [Discord](https://discord.gg/pointcrow).

### All 3 (Emerald, Platinum, and FRLG) of my Warp Randomizer Tracker EmoTracker packs are no longer supported. You can still use them perfectly fine, but I recommend using newer and better trackers.
**My recommendation is Sekii's Web Tracker, available [here](https://sekii.gitlab.io/pokemon-tracker/).**

## Requirements

[EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the Releases section on GitHub.
2. Place the downloaded zip file in the EmoTracker packs directory (defaults to ``My Documents\EmoTracker\packs``).

## Usage

Each warp can be given an icon. To add an icon to a warp, simply left-click on a warp to select it, then left-click on the icon on the left.\
An icon can also be selected as a "quick-mark". Right-click an icon on the left to select it. Right-click a warp to mark it as that icon.

## Bugs? Suggestions?

Feel free to report them by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.
