# EmoTracker pack for Pokémon Emerald Map Randomizers

Based on the tracker for Pokémon Crystal Key Item Randomizers made by DillonIsMyName and Vicendithas, GitHub repository available [here](https://github.com/vicendithas/pokemon-crystal-randomizer-tracker).

It's an EmoTracker pack with maps for the [Universal Warp Randomizer](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/qel5h4/i_created_a_mod_that_randomizes_the_entire_map_of/) used on Pokémon Emerald, available on PointCrow's [Discord](https://discord.gg/pointcrow).

## Requirements

[EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/)

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the Releases section on GitHub.
2. Place the downloaded zip file in the EmoTracker packs directory (defaults to ``My Documents\EmoTracker\packs``).

## Usage

Each warp can be given 3 "tags" that range from "Surf Needed" to "Dead End" to "First Gym". There are also tags for each Hub as well as 8 extra "custom" tags that you can use as extra info. To add a tag to a warp, simply click on the warp, click one of the outlined squares, and finally click one of the tags. It is recommended to turn on Fast Tool Tips to see the descriptions of the tags. Avoid clicking on the Pokéballs, as clicking on all 3 Pokéballs of a warp will make it disappear unless "Show All Locations" is on.

## Bugs? Suggestions?

Feel free to report them by opening an issue on the GitHub repository.
